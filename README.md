# Course Enrollment Data Organizer

This project is designed to assist college professors in managing and organizing student enrollment data for their respective courses. The main functionality includes parsing a master list of student enrollments from a single CSV file and separating the data into individual CSV files for each course. The output files are named course1.csv, course2.csv, and course3.csv. Each file contains a list of students sorted by their grades in descending order, specific to each course.

## Key Features:

-Parse and read a master CSV file containing all student enrollments.

-Separate and organize students into three distinct CSV files based on their courses.

-Sort the students within each course file by their grades in descending order.

-Handle null entries in the data to ensure smooth sorting and processing.

This tool simplifies the task for professors, allowing them to quickly access and review the list of students enrolled in their courses.
